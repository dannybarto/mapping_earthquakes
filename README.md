# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build a map that tracks earthquakes and their magnitudes for the past 7 days. The map identifies each event by including includes pop-up information.

## Project Overview

- Use d3.json() to get tectonic plate data and add the data using the L.geoJSON() layer.
- Style the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map.
- Add the tectonic plate data as an overlay with the earthquake data.
- Add a third map style to allow the user to select from three different maps.




## Resources
- Data Source: [Earthquake Data](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson)
- Data Source: [Fault Line Data]()
- Applications: Visual Studio Code, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS & D3.js

## Summary

- Access GeoJSON data website <a href="">here</a>
- The map displays earthquake data over the past 7 days and plots the location of tectonic plates globally
- Users can view earthquake and magnitude data as well as location by clicking on the pop-up indicators which are represented the various circles on the map
- Users  can toggle the map view in four variations: Street, Satellite, Light and Dark views. 
- You can also choose to toggle the earthquake and tectonic plate data, they both are defaulted to appear. <br>
